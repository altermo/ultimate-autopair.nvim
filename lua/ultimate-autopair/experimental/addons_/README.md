# addons
User of the plugin have useful ideas; here is where I put theme until I decide what to do with them.
You can use them, but:
+ There is no guarantee that they will not be removed
+ There is no guarantee that they will allways work
+ There is no guarantee that they will be fixed cause of bugs
+ There is no guarantee that they will be up to date
+ There is no guarantee that they will allways work the same way
If you really want to use them, please copy them to your config.
