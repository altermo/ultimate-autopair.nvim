## What this file is?
This file contains **notes** about the plugin.
## The incorrect documentation
Cause of how frequent the changes (and whole rewrites) are makes it pretty hard to write documentation which doesn't instantly become outdated.
## The types of extensions
There are three types of extensions:
The ruling extension, extensions which define rules for when to insert pairs, like specific filetype.
The filtering extension, extensions which filters lines, like strings inside and outside of strings.
The insertion extension, extensions which inserts pairs a specific way, like surrounding strings.
